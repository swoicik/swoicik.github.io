<h2 id="the-book" style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE BOOK</h2>

<p>This book is being written for anyone working with educational technology. If you have devices in the hands of student in your distrcit, I want to help. The book is being written from my experience as both a classroom teacher and a distrcit administrator. 

<p>The focus of the book is, how to implement an impactful and sustainable 1:1 program in a K12 environments. Not just giving every kid a device. The book will introduct and advocate the CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) model, but the ideas can be applied to any model you choose.</p>

<p>Many well intentioned and well funded technology initiatives fall flat. Programs fail for any combination of reasons; planning, implementation, culture, understanding, communication, etc. I will share what I have learned and show how to mitigate or remove these obstacles. A 1:1 program is a lot more than just the device. The actual device(s) you choose matter very little.</p>

<p>The technology used in these programs changes constantly, My focus will be on the systems you need in place to make the program work and less about specific technology. The content of the book will apply to any technology initiative you want run, not just a blip in time when (insert your favorite tech) is the current trend.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering is the only way to receive the book on the first day it's available (maybe even a little sooner). There will be few print editions available at launch, pre-ordering will guarantee you get one.</p>

<h3>Direct Feedback</h3>
<p>With the newsletter I will be providing early chapter samples and asking for feedback from you. Your feedback and input will influence the final version of the book.</p>

<h3>Independent Author</h3>
<p>Directly support an independent author. This book is being produced entirely on my own. Any pre-order purchases go directly to helping produce this book and making it free for others.</p>

<h3>EdTech Community</h3>
<p>With enough pre-orders, I will organize and be an active participant in a Slack Community (or similar technology) built around the book’s topics. This community will start before the book’s launch, and continue after.</p>


<h2 id="price" style="text-align: center;">PRICING</h2>

<p>The pricing for the book is very simple, whatever works for your budget. Pay what you want or think is fair, including paying nothing.</p>

<h2 id="faq" style="text-align: center;">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="why-a-book">Why A Book?</h3>
<p>Apart from being a goal to actually write a book, this format seemed the best way to distribute these ideas and best practices in the most beneficial and impactful way. It’s a scaleable way to share an idea.</p>
<h3 id="why-public">Why Public?</h3>
<p>Before deciding to attempt writing a book, I did a lot of research on how to write a book, and reached out to people that had done it before. I wanted an idea of what I was getting into. Most advice boils down to “Just write.” Good advice, but I needed more.</p>
<p>Writing a book is a weird thing. A person works almost in secret (or with a small group of people) for a very long time then releases everything into the world. The final product is known, but very little is shared about the process.</p>
<p>When I’m learning how to code something new, I don’t go look at the final products that people made, I look at the source code and try to figure out how they built it.</p>
<p>I wanted to share the entire process I’m going through (the source code of the book), hopefully it will help someone else.</p>
<p>There are lots of way to contribute and support this project. Any and all ways are greatly appreciated. Projects like this aren’t possible without a community of supporters around it.</p>
