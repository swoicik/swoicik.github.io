<p style="text-align: center;">Online extrovert, real-life introvert.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Hardware</h3>
Apple iPad - This is my daily driver and what I use the most. I've talked about it more in <a href="https://swoicik.com/2017/the-frictionless-computer/">this post.</a>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dell Inspiron 3000 Series – A good, cheap laptop. Wiped clean and installed Elementary OS as soon as I bought it. It mostly stays on my desk.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apple iPhone 8 – I upgraded from an iPhone SE after the screen broke. I have plenty to complain about iOS, but it’s still the most reliable all around smartphone.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Software</h3>
<a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elementary OS</a> – My main operating system. It has all the power of Linux with some great design. It’s how a desktop OS should look.

<a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> - I've recently moved my project management from Podio to Basecamp 3. I've been impressed so far. Basecamp is far more intuitive to use, but does lack some advanced features.

<a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Apps</a> – I use Google Apps for my personal and business email. I don’t use much else from the service besides email.

<a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly</a> – I use this website daily. I’m subscribed to a little over 100 RSS feeds from various sources. All neatly organized in Feedly to read and sort. It’s how I get my news and stay on top of industry information.

<a href="https://github.com/swoicik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> - I've started using GitHub more and more. Any recent code I've produced is on there. I am also <a href="https://swiocik.com/cyod">writing a book</a> on the platform.
<h3>Website</h3>
<a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> - This site is powered by WordPress, my default choice for building a website since I've started building websites.

<a href="http://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a> - This site is hosted on WP Engine. It's the most simple and complete solution for having a self hosted WordPress site.

<a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/sanse/">Sanse</a> - The theme for this website is based off the Sanse theme by <span class="author">Sami Keijonen. </span>
