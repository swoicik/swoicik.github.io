My name is Stephen Woicik, I do a lot of different projects and jobs. Most all of them center around education, technology, and/or business. I’ve worked in educational technology at almost every level of learning. I have worked with countless small businesses to help them run more efficiently with technology. This website is an attempt to collect my work and ideas spread out across many different avenues. The ideas expressed here are my own, and may not reflect the ideas of any organizations I represent.

Some of the tools I used to do this work

## Hardware 
Apple iPad Mini – This is my daily driver and what I use the most. I’ve talked about it more in [this post](/2017/the-frictionless-computer/).

Dell Inspiron 3000 Series – A good, cheap laptop. Wiped clean and installed Elementary OS as soon as I bought it. It mostly stays on my desk.

Apple iPhone 8 – I upgraded from an iPhone SE after the screen broke. I have plenty to complain about iOS, but it’s still the most reliable all around smartphone.

## Software
[Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) – My main operating system. It has all the power of Linux with some great design. It’s how a desktop OS should look.

[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) – I’ve recently moved my project management from Podio to Basecamp 3. I’ve been impressed so far. Basecamp is far more intuitive to use, but does lack some advanced features.

[Google Apps](https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/) – I use Google Apps for my personal and business email. I don’t use much else from the service besides email.

[Feedly](http://feedly.com/) – I use this website daily. I’m subscribed to a little over 100 RSS feeds from various sources. All neatly organized in Feedly to read and sort. It’s how I get my news and stay on top of industry information.

[GitHub](https://github.com/swoicik) – I’ve started using GitHub more and more. Any recent code I’ve produced is on there. I am also [writing a book](/cyod) on the platform.

## Website
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - I recently migrated this site from WordPress to Jekyll. You can read about the process and the reasons on this [blog post](/2019/wordpress-to-jekyll).

[Simple Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/swoicik/simple-jekll-theme) - This is a theme I developed. It's based off the Tale theme. You can read more about it [here](/2019/simple-jekyll-theme)

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. A free hosting option provided by GitHub.
