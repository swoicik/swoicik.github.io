<a href="http://rivikmedia.com">Rivik Media</a> - I co-founded Rivik Media in 2008 as a web development company. It has expanded beyond building websites, to include hosting, marketing, social media, email, and technology consulting.  I am now the sole owner of the company.

<a href="http://1stquality.co">1st Quality Discount Flooring</a> - A new kind of wood flooring company that is offering top tier products at a discount price. Similar to a Marshalls or TJX model. I built and run the IT, infrastructure, and inventory processes for the business.

<a href="https://evrd.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVRD</a> - A fun blog I started in college (and one of my first websites). Originally a <a href="http://everythingrandom.net" target="_blank">tumblr</a> website, it has grown into a collection of websites. At it's peak, it generate 250,000 unique visitors/month. It is still in operation today, being run by a collection of bloggers. I have the occasional post contribution, but still maintain the code and design for the site.

<a href="http://quotey.evrd.net" target="_blank">Quotey</a> - I always love a great quote and have a habit of writing them down. Quotey is a way to share the collection with everyone. If you're interested, head over to <a href="http://quotey.evrd.net" target="_blank">Quotey.net</a> and sign up for the newsletter. You will get quotes deliver daily to your inbox.

<a href="http://swoicik.com/2010/09/29/marker-i-handwritten-font/">Marker I</a> - My first attempt at making my own font, and a fun weekend project. The font is released under creative commons licensing. You can see my blog post explaining everything <a href="http://swoicik.com/2010/09/29/marker-i-handwritten-font/">here</a>.
