This is an ever changing list of the hardware and software I use everyday. I update the list as regularly as possible, but if you ever have a questions, just <a href="http://twitter.com/swoicik" target="_blank">message me</a>&nbsp;on twitter.
<h3>Hardware</h3>
Dell Inspiron 3000 Series - A good, cheap laptop. Wiped clean and installed Elementary OS as soon as I bought it. It mostly stays on my desk.&nbsp;

Apple iPhone SE&nbsp;- I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the SE. I couldn't see spending the money on an iPhone 7 when it came out. The SE provides a good balance of features and price point. I have plenty to complain about iOS, but it's still the most reliable all around smartphone.

Microsoft Surface 3 - I traded in my iPad for the Surface. I wasn't a big fan at first but since the release of Windows 10 it's become better and better. It's what I usually use when I'm away from my desk.&nbsp;
<h3>Software</h3>
<a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank">Elementary OS</a> - My main operating system. It has all the power of Linux with some great design. It's how a desktop OS should look.

<a href="http://podio.com" target="_blank">Podio</a> - How I keep everything organized and in it's place. If I could only use one piece of software to run my business, this would be it.&nbsp;

<a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/" target="_blank">Google Apps</a> - I use Google Apps for my personal and business email. I don't use much else from the service besides email.

<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a> - I use this as a dump for random ideas, links I want to remember, and things that don't need to be taken care of right away. It's not a strict to-do list, more of an I might get around to it list.

<a href="http://feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a> - I use this website daily. I'm subscribed to a little over 100 RSS feeds from various sources. All neatly organized in Feedly for me to read and sort. It's how I get my news and stay on top of industry information.
