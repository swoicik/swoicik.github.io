An amazingly in-depth and lengthy <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">article</a> (38,000 words) on Bloomberg Business about what code is. A bit of history and how it all works. It's something to check out when you have some time to read. So click the link and save the article for later.

Bonus points for the great interactive graphics the team created for the article.
