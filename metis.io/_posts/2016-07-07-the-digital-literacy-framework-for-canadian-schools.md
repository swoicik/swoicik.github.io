<span style="font-weight: 400;">Published and distributed by Media Smarts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a <a href="http://mediasmarts.ca/teacher-resources/use-understand-create-digital-literacy-framework-canadian-schools">massive resource</a> for anyone interested in digital literacy. Educators, administrators, and parents should all have an understanding of digital literacy. As more technology is in front of our students, more work is being done outside the classroom and on the Internet. It is important for everyone to understand what that means. When you visit a website, how is data being collected? How is your data being turned into advertisements? What does anonymous mean online? What is public, what is private? What is a good password? How do you keep digital information secure? It is a new way of thinking and learning that we need to understand. Less and less of what we produce is physical. It is digital code stored on a server. </span>
