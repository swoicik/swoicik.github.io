<div style="padding: 3px; text-align: left;">I finally got my Ubuntu desktop set up the way I want.  Its running on a MacBook unibody (I rarely ever boot into OSX now).  In the past I used linux for everything but have fallen out of touch lately.  Using it as my main computer for a few months should get be back into the swing of things.</div>
So far I have very few complaint about the newest Ubuntu.  It's fast.  It boots up and shuts down as fast, if not faster, than OSX.  It is sluggish when coming out of hibernation though (a minor problem since I rarely completely shut more computer down).

The software update and installation is getting better with every version of Ubuntu.  When I used Linux in the past, I remember having to go into the terminal to install most things, that is almost completely gone.  Anything in the Ubuntu Software Center is a simple one-click install.  The software updates work similar to Windows and OSX; it alerts you when updates are available and will download and install with a single click.

I have confidence that the average computer user would not see any difference in using Ubuntu compared to using OSX or Windows.  It's a very polished operating system.

The one downside I have had, is my back-lit keyboard doesn't seem to work at all with Ubuntu.  I haven't found the driver yet to fix this.  Other than that, every other driver has worked right out of the box.
