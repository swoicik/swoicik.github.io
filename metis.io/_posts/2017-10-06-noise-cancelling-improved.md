This may exists already, it may not.

I would like a pair of noise canceling headphones that can be taught or learn when to interrupt the music.

For example, whenever my name is said, the microphone on the headphones picks this up and pauses the music.

Another example, whenever the phone rings, or there is a knock on the door, I am alerted and not completely oblivious to what's going on around me. The music could stop whenever there is an announcement on the train/subway.

I could see this being a big help in an office, or working from home, or being on public transportation.

What do you think? Does this already exists?
