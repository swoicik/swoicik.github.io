I have been very interested in mesh networks recently. It's not a brand new idea, but has received a lot of public interest lately. The software and technology has come a long way. The popularity of smartphones and tablets provide a new and more prevalent system for developing the mesh network.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">Mesh networks</a>Â are a natural fit for school systems. A system that is densely populated with devices all using one network in a limited area (the school). However, I haven't seen many examples of a mesh network being used, and would be curious to see it deployed.
<blockquote>A <b>mesh network</b> is a network topology in which each node relays data for the network. All mesh nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network.</blockquote>
For many school, that are relying on aging hardware and infrastructure to support growing use, mesh networks provide some relief from the network stress by allowing devices to act as nodes. Not putting all the strain on single access points or switches.

Are there any school systems or companies working to implement this? I have seen commercial uses, but little in the K12 education sector.
