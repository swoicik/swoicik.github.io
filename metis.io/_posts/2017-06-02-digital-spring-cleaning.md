<p id="7f3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">How often do you take a look at all the online accounts you have? I tend to create a lot of online accounts. Most of them are free anyways. I create accounts just to see what a new website is about. Often only using the account once and losing interest.</p>
<p id="8c5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you delete these old accounts or leave them in case you wish to return?</p>
<p id="de24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I recently started going through and deleting as many of them as I could remember/find. A good place to start is with email newsletters. Most of these services send you newsletters. Go through your inbox and find the ones that no longer interest you. Unsubscribe and delete your account from the site.</p>
