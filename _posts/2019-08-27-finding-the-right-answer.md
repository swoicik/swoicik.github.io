I refer to the quote above a lot in my work. I think it represents a great shift in how we understand and process information. Answers are no longer hard to come by. Type any question you want into Google, and you're given 1,000's of possible answers. Finding the right answer has become a bit harder.

I no longer have to hunt for an answer, but I have to hunt and research for the correct answer. Or I have to change the question I am asking entirely.

How often do you find yourself just clicking through every link on a Google search tying to find the one that tells you what you actually want?

This is what brings me to today's announcement. Rivik Media is building a community of small business owners to help find the right answer. Today is the official launch of **The Community**.

The best part of running Rivik Media is working with great business owners. Many of these clients have become mentors or partners in other projects. They have become my own business community. It's great to be able to go to someone who has already been through or is going through your exact situation of running a small business. It's the best way to get "the right answer."

The Community is an attempt to make this small business community, yours as well. I want to connect past, present, and future clients and small business owners together. Everyone will benefit from this community as much as I have.
