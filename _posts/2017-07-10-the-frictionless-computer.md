I have long been a user of open source software. Installing Linux (most recently <a href="http://swoicik.com/2015/setting-up-elementary-os-freya/">Elementary OS</a>) on all my computers, and trying to use open source alternatives whenever possible. Despite my personal preference to use open source software, I regularly find myself going back to the iPad as my daily driver.

It sounds like a marketing gimmick, but it's true. The iPad takes zero effort. Apple has removed almost all the friction points from using technology. There is no barrier to entry. Just pick up an iPad and open an app.

You never have to restart the iPad. You rarely ever turn it off. It always on and ready to go. It works with single purpose apps, make sure it runs fast. It's a challenge to make an iPad stutter or freeze by design. Apps and software update in the background, and often automatically while it's charging. It's rare I need to go into the App Store or settings and update something.

The iPad is the ultimate portable computer. You can hold it like a book to read or browse. You can lay it down on a desk for drawing or image editing. I can pair it with a keyboard and use it like a laptop for writing. The device it's completely adaptable.

I should also note that my current phone is an iPhone SE. Apple has that Trojan horse that already has me using their ecosystem daily. Grabbing the iPad to do work doesn't feel out of place, even though I use a Linux desktop most the time at my desk.

It's not all perfect, but it doesn't have to be. There is a reason I still use Linux and open source software. Some things just can't be done well on the iPad.

If I know I am going to be somewhere for an extended time working (over an hour or so), I will use my laptop. If I need to do image editing or graphic design, I still prefer a big screen I get buy extending my laptop to an external monitor. You can plug the iPad into an external monitor but the resolution makes it almost impossible to use outside of watching a movie or typing.

But the iPad is great for carrying around during the day or travel. It can do most of what I need. And as long as I can get to a laptop or desktop once a week (sometimes once a month) I'll still get all my work done.

It's a perfect everyday computer. It's frictionless. I never have to worry about it. Just unlock it and start working.
