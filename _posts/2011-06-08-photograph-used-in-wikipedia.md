Through <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/woicik/" target="_blank">Flickr,</a> someone discovered a photograph I took of my grandfathers dog tags from World War II. The individual was writing an article for Wikipedia on <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_chaplain_symbols" target="_blank">Religious Symbolism in the United States Military</a></em>. The "C" at the end of the dog tags stands for Catholic, something I would have never known. The picture fit in well with the article and I released the permissions to use the image. You can view the image on Wikipedia <a title="Dog Tag Catholic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dog_Tag_Catholic.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.
