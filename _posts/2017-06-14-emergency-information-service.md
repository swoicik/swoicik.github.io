<p id="08af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I want an app or website that is able to give me the local emergency information for whatever area I am in. A service like this would be helpful for many different situations.</p>
<p id="ce49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently to get this information I use Google. I do a few Google searched with the department I want with the zip code or town name. It works pretty well. All the information I need is certainly out there.</p>
<p id="548e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It should be easier though. And need to be quicker if you ever have a real emergency. An app that can use your location, or you input it and you get all the information you need for that area; Local police, firefighters, poison control, animal control, town hall, nearest hospital.</p>
<p id="66e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Bonus if you can make it work over SMS, for when you donâ€™t have access to the internet. For example, text Police + Area Code and get the contact number for the local police department sent to you.</p>
