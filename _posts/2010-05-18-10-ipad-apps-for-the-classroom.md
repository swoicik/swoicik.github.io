A follow up to <a href="http://stephenwoicik.com/blog/2010/05/the-ipad-and-education/" target="_blank">The iPad and Education</a> post.  This is a quick list of 10 apps on the iPad that you can use with your students, most of which are free.  The list is broken up into subjects; Math, English, Science, Social Studies, and Note Taking. If you have any app suggestions of your own, please leave a note in the comments.
<h3>Math</h3>
<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-graph/id292412367?mt=8a" target="_blank">Quick Graph</a></strong> (free) - A complete graphic calculator application. Able to handle both 2D and 3D graphs. Input as many formulas as you want. A custom keyboard makes inputting easier. No need to go through the tedious Apple keyboard sub-menus to get to math functions (great for writing, not for math).

<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-calculator/id300311831?mt=8" target="_blank">PCalc Lite</a></strong> (free) - This is the calculator the iPad should have came with.  The lite version (free) will handle  your needs for the average math class.  The paid features refer to more themes and much higher level computing, aimed more for the college or professional level.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1379" title="pcalc" alt="" src="http://fordhamretc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pcalc.jpg" width="480" height="320" />
<h3>English and Reading</h3>
<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000490441&amp;tag=gocous-20&amp;hvadid=4891537517&amp;ref=pd_sl_89aqw2qpeb_b" target="_blank">Kindle for iPad</a></strong> (free) - Requires Amazon account.  Connects to the Amazon Book Store, the same store used by the Kindle.  All your books purchased from Amazon will be synced together between your iPad, Kindle, iPhone, Desktop, Laptop, or any other device that has the Amazon eBook Application (including bookmarks).  This is nice if you don't allow students to take the iPad home. They can access their books through the Amazon desktop application on any computer.

<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dictionary-com-dictionary/id364740856?mt=8" target="_blank">Dictionary and Thesaurus</a> </strong>(free) - Pretty self explanatory.  This free app from dictionary.com offers a straight forward dictionary and thesaurus to use on the iPad.  A simple but needed feature for use in the classroom.
<h3>Writing and Note Taking</h3>
<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8" target="_blank">Evernote</a></strong> (free) - Requires and Evernote account.  Personally, this was my note taking app of choice during college.  I was using it on a laptop but the program is the same.  The organization structure is great, you can keep all your notes organized by class, topic, or any way you see fit.  You can add photos and videos to your notes, or even voice memos.  Evernote syncs your notes with your online account, so they are accessible through the app on <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/" target="_blank">any device</a> (laptop,desktop,  iPad, cell phone...).

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Notes </strong>(free) - The default note taking application for the iPad is not to shabby. It's great for quickly jotting down thoughts and ideas.  You can email the notes to work on them on your computer.  This isn't an application where you will manage all your notes (no real organization system), and it doesn't sync with other device.  This would be an app you could use on a field trip.  Students can jot down things they see during the day and review them later in class.</p>

<h3>History and Social Studies</h3>
<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/constitution-for-ipad/id363287472?mt=8" target="_blank">US Constitution</a> </strong>(free) &amp; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/declaration-for-ipad/id367735045?mt=8" target="_blank"><strong>The Declaration of Independence</strong></a> (free) - These apps turn historical documents into easy to read text documents on the iPad.  The US Constitution is separated by section for easy navigation and search.  The Declaration of Independence include images of the original document.

<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycongress/id364897048?mt=8" target="_blank">MyCongress</a></strong> (free) - This is an application for data on <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/" target="_blank">OpenCongress.org</a>.  View information on bills being debated, the profiles of you elected officials, or send an email to your representative.  You can even search by area code to view information relevant to your local government.  This is a good App to get students involved in the US Government and see what's happening today.  *It's worth noting that this is not an official government resource, more information <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/about" target="_blank">here</a>.*
<h3>Science</h3>
<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id364147847?mt=8" target="_blank">The Elements</a></strong> (13.99) - Although the most expensive App on the list, it is also one of the most powerful.  It has been featured on the Apple website as one of the best Apps for the iPad.  The App provides an interactive and in-depth periodic table, with examples of each elements and detailed information.  All within a simple and organized touch navigation.
<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdiIaIUTBEc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0]</p>
<strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-for-ipad-interactive/id363486802?mt=8" target="_blank">Star Walk</a> </strong>(4.99) - A full featured astronomy app.  It has a digital compass which allow students to hold the iPad up towards the sky and see a live representation of the stars in the sky.  You can view how the sky looked or will look on a specific date.  Find days of eclipses and meteor showers and bookmark your findings for access later.  Also get detailed information on the planets or specific constellation.
