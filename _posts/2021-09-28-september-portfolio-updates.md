Here are the September Portfolio Updates. For background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

Things have been steady as they go for the month of September. I stayed quite and didn't buy much. I added slightly to a few of my bedrock stocks and continue to dollar cost average into Crypto. 

My Watch List has been growing and I plan to buy some more soon. Looking for a good opportunity. Things still feel high right now. Some of the stocks on my short list are Monday (MNDY), Twilio (TWLO), HubSpot (HUBS), Corsair Gaming (CRSR), and Carvana (CVNA). 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
