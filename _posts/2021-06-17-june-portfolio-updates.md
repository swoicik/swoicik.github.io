Here is the June Portfolio Update. Not a lot to talk about this month, but there was a lot added last month if you want to take a look, [May Portfolio Updates](https://swoicik.com/2021/may-portfolio-updates). And for general background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

Two updates on the stock side of things.
- Sold BOX. This was a small postion I've had since 2015. It was part of an investment into the cloud storage and computing space. The basic thesis that Box would be the cloud storage choice for enterprise. Google and Microsoft have vastly improved their offerings toward business over the years, and I don't see a competitive advatange for BOX. I still like Box the company, but the stock has been pretty much flat and I don't see high growth in the future.

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.

As a final note, here is a stock from my watch list. BYND (Beyond Meat) has been one I am looking at a lot more. It's a tough stock for me to actually buy in to. The industry has huge growth potential in the next several years. It's already grown exponentially over the past few years. Normally I would buy a basket of stocks in the industry and let the market figure out a winner. With this industry, many of the companies are not public yet. BYND is one of the first. I don't know if BYND really has a competitive advantage. Do you buy BYND just to get into the industry? Wait until more companies are public in this space? I like the industry, but don't particulary like this company.
