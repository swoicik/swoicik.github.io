I recently conducted an Introduction to Google Classroom presentation during a professional development day. The PD was aimed at getting teachers more comfortable with Google Classroom and showing them how it helps with classroom management.

The PD was done with grade 6-8 teachers in a Google Apps district. Teachers have had access to Google Classroom since the start of school, some using it heavily, some not at all. So there was a large disparity in the skill and comfort level of everyone in the PD.

The PD lasted about 3 hours and started off with a Google Slides presentation, then a small group breakout activity, and concluded with Q&amp;A.Â  The Google Slides presentation was specific to the school, so I am not going to share it here, but the small group activity is universal and I wanted to share it with any other schools or teachers that are using Google Classroom.

Follow the link to view the activity and instruction. You can also create a copy in your Google Drive to edit and modify it.

The activity splits teachers up into groups of 4-5 and take a 1-1.5 hours to complete. It's good to split teachers up into groups of varying skill level.

In the small groups, one person will be a teacher of a Google Classroom, the other members will be students. The goal is to really see how Google Classroom looks from the student perspective.
