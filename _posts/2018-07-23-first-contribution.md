</a><a href="/cyod">This project</a> has received its first financial contribution.

The contribution was made anonymously through the <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/swoicik">Buy me a coffee</a> link.

Thank you to whoever the anonymous contributor was. It’s certainly given some validation to this project.

It is very encouraging to have someone actually put their money towards supporting a project like this. It’s even more surprising to get a contribution after not promoting this project outside of a few <a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik">tweets</a>.
