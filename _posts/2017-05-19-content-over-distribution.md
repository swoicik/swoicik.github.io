<p id="0a75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’ve worked with a number of business owners, and I’ve seen many of them fall for this trap (myself included). Focusing more on getting the word out than what the word actually is.</p>
<p id="b87c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Focus on creating the content (or product) that people actually want before trying to get everyone in the world to see it. If the quality is there, the quantity will follow. The internet has a great social sharing effect. If you are creating good content, it’ll get discovered and shared.</p>
<p id="40c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than trying to find the best platform to publish on, or making sure you hit every social network. Make sure what you are producing is worth producing.</p>
<p id="36f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Once you have content that is worth reading, you can work on distributing it (or someone else will do that for you).</p>
