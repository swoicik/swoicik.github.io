For the past month I have been using the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/). Its based on Chrome but is much more privacy focused. It also has a unique model involving its own blockchain token called [BAT](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) (Basic Attention Token). 

Brave awards users BAT for clicking on relevant advertisements. The tokens can then be converted into cash or used to tip/reward websites and creators you want to support. 

I have been enjoying using the browser and collecting BAT. 

I made the decision to add this site to the Brave Verified Publishers list. If you are using the Brave Browser and collection BAT, you can now leave a tip on this website. 

Brave makes everything very easy to set up. I will be running this as long as I'm using the Brave Browser. Which started as an experiment, but is slowly becoming my go to browser option.
