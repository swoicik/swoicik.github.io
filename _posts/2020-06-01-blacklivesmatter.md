It’s hard to be on social media the past days and see everything happen in real time across this country. It feels like it all happened in an instant, but I know that’s not true. It has been building for years and generations. 

I’m usually quiet. I don’t take sides and try to see everyone’s opinion. But I was recently reminded the silence is a stance. And not a stance I can have in this situation. There needs to be a side taken and not simply be on the sideline.

“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” by Edmund Burke

I’m also reminded of the quote, “it’s always darkest before the dawn.” I hope this is our darkest time and the light and change is coming soon. I don’t pretend to have the answer or claim to understand everything going on. But I know progress needs to be made.
