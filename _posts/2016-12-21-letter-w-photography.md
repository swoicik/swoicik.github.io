I have started selling some of my photography online under the name, Letter W Photography. I have uploaded content to both <a href="https://society6.com/swoicik" target="_blank">Society6</a> and <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/letterw" target="_blank">Redbubble</a>.

I have had great success with Redbubble in the past on other projects, so it was easy to start there. Society6 is relatively new for me, so we'll see how it goes. If there are any photographers out there that of other suggestion, leave a comment.

I've posted many of my photos on various sites; Flickr, 500px, Facebook, Instagram, etc, and always planned to sell my photography at some point, but never found a solution I liked.

I originally, and still want to open my own online store for the photography (a project I don't have the time for). The next option was toÂ outsource the overhead work to print on demand services. I upload and edit the image, Redbubble and Society6 handles the selling, printing, and shipping.

These print on demand services also allow for my photographs to be used on a variety of products beyond simple prints. Tote bags, iPhones cases, notebooks, and canvas prints are all available. Well beyond what I could offer on my own.
