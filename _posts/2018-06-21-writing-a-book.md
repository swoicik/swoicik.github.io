I am writing a book, and I am documenting the process of writing the book.

I didn’t originally plan to write a book. I have never written a book before or consider myself a writer). But as I collected notes, wrote down ideas, and tried to figure out what I could do with this information, a book seemed the best option. Something had to be produced with the information, it was to stuck in my head to just go away. A book would potentially have the biggest impact.

Once deciding to write a book, there was a lot of research into how to write a book. Reading blog posts, books on writing, and talking to people who had written books before. I got a lot of great information, and thank you to everyone who took time to answer my questions. But I didn’t get to look into the actual process of writing a book. The revisions, the editing, or the decision process to get from idea to book.

This <a href="https://swoicik.com/category/cyod">site</a>, and subsequent writing on <a href="https://github.com/swoicik/cyod">GitHub</a>, will show my entire writing process from idea to finished product. You can see ideas from when I started (even the bad ones), where those ideas went, and how the book evolved overtime. My hope is that beyond just writing a useful book, I will help show others how to write a book as well. So that anyone that has an idea but seems intimidated with writing an entire book will get some guidance.

I was inspired to write a book in this way after reading many other great books on GitHub.

The actual content of the book will be on <a href="https://github.com/swoicik/cyod">GitHub</a>. The updates about the writing will be on swoicik.com under the category <a href="https://swoicik.com/category/cyod">CYOD</a>.
