Email newsletters are having a resurgence. They have been around forever, but are really being utilized by smaller companies and individuals now. You can get some great content, and all for free.

The problem is, this floods my nice clean inbox. The software for sending newsletter is getting cheaper and easier, but my inbox isn't getting smarter or better at managing these emails.

I want an app that has a throwaway email address that I can subscribe to different newsletters. The app will organize the newsletters by where they came from and chronological order. I can view them as I want, and save the ones I like. All without taking up space in my inbox.
