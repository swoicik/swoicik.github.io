> This post is part of an ongoing series of post related to the process of writing a book about educational technology. Learn more about the book [here](https://swoicik.com/cyod).

The book is starting to come together and getting some actual production value added. If you haven't [pre-ordered](https://gumroad.com/l/CvEGu) your copy already, please do so (it's free).

I have begun designing a few different book cover options. I wanted to share some of the best options and get your feedback.

**Option 1**

All designs were done in the amazing [Canva App](https://canva.com). Which I highly recommend.
