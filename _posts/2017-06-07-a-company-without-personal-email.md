<p id="c7e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Instead of everyone at your company having their own email, why not just have a shared group email. I.e. instead of having bwayne@example.com and ckent@example.com, you would just have hello@example.com.</p>
<p id="bce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me this makes sense for any business that deals with consumers. Why make your customers know multiple emails at your company. If a customer wants to get ahold of you they should only need to contact one address and the message will get dealt with internally to get to the right person.</p>
<p id="8d58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This also benefits the company because you will have a shared history of contact with this customer. It doesn’t matter who in the company responds to the customer, it’s just a response from the company. In the future anyone in the company should be able to pick up the conversation and see the entire history of the relationship.</p>
<p id="b2d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve begun testing this in some of my own businesses. Without personal email, much of the internal communication system changes. Instead of sending an email and cc’ing everyone, employees can post a group message in Basecamp or Slack.</p>
<p id="a8dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not without its problems though. User accounts for employees can be an issue sometimes. Email has become pretty universal when setting up any online service. So, if you do use a cloud system to manage your shared email (Zendesk, Helpscout, etc.). You’ll still need some kind of employee email to set up their accounts on the service.</p>
