<blockquote>There is no such thing as the cloud. It is just someone else's computer.</blockquote>
Cloud computing has been revolutionary for the Internet. It has given access to resources that the average user would never have. But as the cloud become more ubiquitous with our lives online, it's important to remember what the cloud actually is.

The Cloud is the current buzz word for it, but the concept isn't new. A user rents space or resources on another person's or company's computer. The user places the trust in someone else to manage, maintain, and control the data placed in the cloud.

When data is placed in the cloud, the user no longer has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine" target="_blank">reasonable right to privacy</a> of the data. Whoever has access or control of the cloud you are using has equal access and rights.
