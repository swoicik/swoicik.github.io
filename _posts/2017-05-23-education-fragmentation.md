<p id="f578" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s a trend in education that is becoming more and more common. A school district will pick a single technology platform to build from. Are you a Google district? Apple? Microsoft?</p>
<p id="5679" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easy to understand why districts choose a platform. It makes everything easier. It brings consistency across your schools, makes PD easier, makes managing costs easier, and many of these platforms will offer services for free.</p>
<p id="a36b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But are we doing a disservice to students by limiting their technology options.</p>
<p id="27fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s no secret that students will need to be technology proficient when they leave schools. Is it a disadvantage if a school system is showing students how to use the technology and software from one company?</p>
