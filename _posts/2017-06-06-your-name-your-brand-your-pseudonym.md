<p id="4d65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What name do you work under?</p>
<p id="2091" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve heard a lot of conflicting information about this, and I’ve gone back and forth on it. Should you create a brand for each thing you want to talk about or create. Or do you do it all under one name.</p>
<p id="4654" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I lean towards doing it all under one name. The idea of specializing in one thing and having your name or brand associated with that one thing seems outdated. You can have a single brand and cover a wide range of topics. Why limit what you can talk about to stay on message?</p>
<p id="efcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">How do you handle this situation? Do you publish everything under one name, or separate it out into different brands, project, websites, publications, etc?</p>
