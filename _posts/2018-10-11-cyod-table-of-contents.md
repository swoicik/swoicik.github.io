<blockquote>This post is part of an ongoing series of post related to the process of writing a book about educational technology. Learn more about the book <a href="https://swoicik.com/cyod/">here</a>.</blockquote>
I’ve collected notes, conducted research, and began writing this book (<a href="https://swoicik.com/cyod/">CYOD</a>), and now have a good idea about what the structure will be. I talked before about the <a href="https://swoicik.com/2018/writing-style/">writing style</a> of the book, but now I’ll share the actual outline I am working with.

The book will be divided into 5 main themes/sections with short chapters in each. The following outline show all the chapters I have so far, but not necessarily in order. Any input on the structure, order, or content would be greatly appreciated. Reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik">Twitter</a> with any feedback.
