I discovered a great community discussion on using Linux in the classroom. The thread can be found on <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1469836-linux-in-the-academic-setting" target="_blank">Spiceworks</a> and is one of the few current discussion Iâ€™ve found (with comments from 2016). Some of the comments can be a bit technical, but it provides a great overview and a lot of different opinions on using Linux or any open source software in a school system. <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1469836-linux-in-the-academic-setting" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.
