<p id="36aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Anyone who works in tech, or any industry by now, has heard of or used <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. It has become wildly popular as the latest productivity tool.</p>
<p id="fe14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Slack is labeled as a team communication app. It’s the next step of office chat. A high powered version of email. It’s big advantage, is it’s integration with so many other apps.</p>

<blockquote id="8981" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">If email is someone else’s to do list, what does that make Slack?</blockquote>
<p id="3c54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Communication is key in business, but it’s also a distraction from work. I need to communicate with the people I work with, but I don’t need to be constantly connected.</p>
<p id="ad44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having an alert for every little thing, and being able to communicate so quickly is a drain on my productivity. It’s makes it harder to block things out and filter what is really important.</p>
<p id="03e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tries Slack for a short time, but was quickly frustrated by it. I’d prefer email, or another asynchronous communication platform. I must not be the intended market for the app, but I have a hard time envisioning who is.</p>
