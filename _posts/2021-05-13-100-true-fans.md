[Kevin Kelly, on The Technium](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)
> 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom. Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with a thousand true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there.

This has long been one of my favorite posts to read when starting a new project or idea. It helps put into perspective what you are doing. What do you need to get going. If you make the goal of your business to be the best in the world, or to have millions of customers, you will get deflated before you reach that goal. It's too big and too broad to understand during the day to day grind of doing any kind of creative project. 1,000 is a number and goal you can wrap your head around. It makes sense and seems possible.

I hope you enjoy and get as much from this essay as I do. And for those that don't know who Kevin Kelly is, check out his [about page](https://kk.org/about-me).
