<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave your comfort zone, and write what matters to you, not what ‘everyone’ will like.</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you focus on writing what’s really on your mind — instead of what you think you should be writing — you create more impactful pieces that will stand the test of time.</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The author even has some tips for figuring out when you're writing something honestly and how to know you're on the right track.</span>
