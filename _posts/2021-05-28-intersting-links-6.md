Whenever my browser has to many tabs open, I will share some links that are interesting enough to save. Some I’ve read, some I want to read, some I’ve saved away for a future idea. Hopefully you will get some benefit from the shared knowledge.

Volume 6 is another ndom collection of links from tweets, newsletters and posts I've found and didn't want to forget. 

**[Skiff](https://skiff.org/)** - Described as Signal, but for your documents. Skiff is a "privacy-first collaboration platform" similar to an encrypted version of Google Docs. It is an online text editor where the content is only visable to you and whoever you give access to. Skiff is not able to read any of your projects or data. I set up my account and started playing around with Skiff. It's already a very polished program. One feature I'd like to see added is a Google Sheet/Excel type document support (outside of just text). 

**[CrossClave](https://spideroak.com/crossclave/)** - Keeping the privacy focuses topic going, CrossClave is the latest product from [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/). It is a privacy focus chat tool for business (think Slack with encryption).  The software also has the ability to share files and work cross platform while providing zero-knowledge encryption. Meaning SpiderOak (or anyone else you don't give access) won't be able to view your work.  

**[mmm.page](https://build.mmm.page)** - A refreshingly different type of website builder. Website builders have been around for a long time. Over the past 5 years, many of these builders seem to be converging to the same minimalistic design style. If you want something that looks different, choatic, and personal, look at the sites built with mmm.page. It reminds me of the old GeoCities or basic HTML homepages that were once popular. It's also really simple to use. 

**[Bankless HQ](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-1-starting-with-bankless)** - As the opening paragraph of their page suggest:

> This guide is your roadmap to the unknown. It’s your guide to the wild west of open finance. Don’t worry about figuring this out all at once. Just commit to learning a bit each week.

Bankless is a newsletter that talks about well... not using a bank. There is a lot of talk about Crytpocurrencies and services around crypto as an alternative to banks. In my most recent [portfolio update](https://swoicik.com/2021/may-portfolio-updates), I shared my cryptocurrency holdings. The ides of going partially bankless is very interesting and something I have been looking at much more seriously lately. 

**[Too Much Focus](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/21/979183329/too-much-focusing-is-draining-heres-a-better-strategy)** - An interesting read on productivity from NPR. You've probably heard that multitasking isn't the best for productivity. The cost of swtiching between tasks ultimately drains your brain more than just doing the tasks one at a time. But this article brings up that you can go to far in the other direction as well. Hyperfocus on single task for extended periods of time can also decrease your abilities. The article has 6 tips to improve your productivity. 

**[Signal Jabs at Facebook](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/signal-app-is-surging-in-popularity-and-hitting-growing-pains)** - This article on Bloomberg got my attention today. Signal has become very popular in 2021 (after WhatsApp privacy issues). This article talks about the growing pains that came with that. It also gave a lot of good insight into Signal, the company. The privacy focused software development company is notorouly private about their actual company as well. Their CEO, Moxie Marlinspike, is also a very interesting person to learn what you can about. 

That’s all for now. If you find any of these links useful or interesting, let me know on twitter, [@swoicik](https://twitter.com/swoicik), or join the discussion [here](https://github.com/swoicik/swoicik.github.io/discussions/7).
