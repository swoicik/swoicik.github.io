Whenever my browser has to many tabs open, I will share some links that are interesting enough to save. Some I’ve read, some I want to read, some I’ve saved away for a future idea. Hopefully you will get some benefit from the shared knowledge.

Volume 6 is another ndom collection of links from tweets, newsletters and posts I've found and didn't want to forget. 

**[Skiff](https://skiff.org/)** - Described as Signal, but for your documents. Skiff is a "privacy-first collaboration platform" similar to an encrypted version of Google Docs. It is an online text editor where the content is only visable to you and whoever you give access to. Skiff is not able to read any of your projects or data. I set up my account and started playing around with Skiff. It's already a very polished program. One feature I'd like to see added is a Google Sheet/Excel type document support (outside of just text). 

**[CrossClave](https://spideroak.com/crossclave/)** -

**[mmm.page](https://build.mmm.page)** -  

**[Bankless HQ](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-1-starting-with-bankless)** - 

**[Too Much Focus](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/21/979183329/too-much-focusing-is-draining-heres-a-better-strategy)** - 

**[Signal Jabs at Facebook](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/signal-app-is-surging-in-popularity-and-hitting-growing-pains)** - This article on Bloomberg got my attention today. Signal has become very popular in 2021 (after WhatsApp privacy issues). This article talks about the growing pains that came with that. It also gave a lot of good insight into Signal, the company. The privacy focused software development company is notorouly private about their actual company as well. Their CEO, Moxie Marlinspike, is also a very interesting person to learn what you can about. 

That’s all for now. If you find any of these links useful or interesting, let me know on twitter, [@swoicik](https://twitter.com/swoicik), or join the discussion [here](https://github.com/swoicik/swoicik.github.io/discussions/7).
