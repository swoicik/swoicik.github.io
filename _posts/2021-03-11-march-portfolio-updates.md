Not too long ago, I published [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money) on this site. That posts makes the argument that money should be a topic of conversation. It's the only way everyone will understand it better. 

In that post I shared my current investing portfolio and promised to post regular updates. Here is the March 2021 update...

Only one small change for January. I sold a very small position in Ford (F). I had a better use for the cash after Ford had a good run up the past few months. 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
