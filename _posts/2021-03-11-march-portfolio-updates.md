Not too long ago, I published [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money) on this site. That posts makes the argument that money should be a topic of conversation. It's the only way everyone will understand it better. 

In that post I shared my current investing portfolio and promised to post regular updates. Here is the March 2021 update...

I sold Under Armour. I have had a very small position in them for a long time that has not done will. With the recent market run up, the stock had just a bit of profit and I had better investments for the money. 3D Systems is also on my short lists for stocks I may be selling soon to re-invest the money elsewhere. 

I took three small positions in Lemonade, Upstart, and Upwork. Three stocks I plan to add more to in the future. I wanted to start getting some money in the game though. 

The last addiition was just added yesterday, Roblox. Roblox had their IPO on March 10th. This is a stock I have been very excited about. If you don't know what Roblox is, you likely don't have a child in grade school. It's a massive gaming, creating, and social network for the younger generation. It feels like a more advanced Minecraft. I added a small position on the IPO. I will most likey wait a couple weeks for things to setting down before adding more to the position. 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
