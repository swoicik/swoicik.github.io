There are a lot of decisions to be made when running a business. You have to take in a lot of information, formulate a plan, and work on a deadline. It can be overwhelming, and force you into a state of over thinking. 

The easiest way to make a decision is to start doing something. It’s easier to make a decision when you are actively working on the problem. It’s very difficult to make a decision and very easy to overthink a problem when you are just “thinking” about it. 

There are too many variables with hypotheticals and philosophies about the problem. Start active and get concrete information and experience to make decision. 

Maybe your action starts down a wrong path, but you’ll be able to correct quickly and realize you mistake. Get starting with doing and don’t get stuck with just planning. 

Just Start

**Recommended Reading:**

[Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. This is one of the best business books out there, and one I regularly recommend to anyone starting or running a business. The tag lines says it all, “Rework shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business.” 

It’s a book that cuts through a lot of the useless business school talk, and get to actionable advice.
