<p id="5ccb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I constantly write random thoughts on sticky notes, scraps of paper, and untitled documents. These notes sometimes get organized, sometimes get lost, and sometimes turn into actual work. No matter what, they take up space (physical, virtual, or mental).</p>
<p id="f354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The goal of this publication is to put all these random thoughts and ideas into one place. They may turn into actual pieces or work, they may just sit here, or they may inspire someone else. But they will stop taking up space on my desk.</p>
<p id="04ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I hope readers fine something useful from these notes. And if you do end up creating something from a note you find here, please let me know. Iâ€™d be happy to share the link to your work with everyone else.</p>
