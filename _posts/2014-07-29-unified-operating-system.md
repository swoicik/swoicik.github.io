Microsoft has recently announced they will be creating a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5928219/microsoft-will-merge-windows-into-one-os" target="_blank">unified operating system</a>. Combining several versions on Windows, including Windows RT and Windows Phone, into a single operating system to run across all devices. This is bring my ideal computer set up closer to reality. IÂ want to be able to have my smartphone (currently a Lumia 1520), connect to a computer/screen and boot into a full desktop environment. I can handle 80% of my work on my Lumia 1520, but there are still times I need a full desktop, or just want to work on a bigger screen.

This functionality was promised with <a title="Ubuntu for Android" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone/ubuntu-for-android" target="_blank">Ubuntu for Android</a>. A project I was very much looking forward to, but no progress was ever made or code released. The project was eventually scrapped and the team left to focus strictly on the Ubuntu Phone.

Here's hoping Windows truly will pull off the unified operating system and bring the idea of one device to do everything to reality.
