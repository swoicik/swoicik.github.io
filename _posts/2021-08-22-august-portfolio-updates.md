Here is the August Portfolio Update. For background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

The market continues it's great run from July. I made a lot of trades in July. As a result, August was pretty quiet. I'm happy where my portfolio is at right now. 

On the crypto side of things, I sold my position in ADA. This isn't a knock on the crypto, it just hit an all time high and it seems a good time to take some profits. I will take my change to buy baack in at a lower price. If that never happens, it won't bother me.

I continue to dollar cost average in to Bitcoin and Ethereum. I have not made any altcoin purchases since my last update in [June](https://swoicik.com/2021/june-portfolio-updates). 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
