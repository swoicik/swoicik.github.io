<p>Here was my first attempt at making a font.  A basic "crayon" style handwritten font. It certainly looks like a child's handwriting, so the lined paper seemed fitting. Released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative commons</a> licensing.  You're welcome to use and adapt the font, just share alike.  If you feel inclined, let me know when the font has been used in your work (<a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@swoicik</a>), not necessary though.</p>
