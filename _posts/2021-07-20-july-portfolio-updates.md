Here is the July Portfolio Update. For background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

The market had a good run up in late June and early July. As a result, several positions were sold in the brokerage account. Some of the money was re-invested, most was left in cash for the time being. 

Taking Profits - These are stocks sold becuase of a better than average gain, and I wanted to take some profits. 
- DOCU
- UPST
- CVNA
- ETSY
- PINS
- SHOP
- LMND

Keeping Cash - These are stocks sold becuase they have been flat since owning. I will buy back in if an opportunity comes up. 
- ATVI
- ETSY
- TWLO
- ZEN

Cutting Losses - These are stocks that have been losing and I no longer wanted them in my portoflio. 
- DKNG
- PENN

On the crypto side of things, it has been steady as it goes. No major investments, but I continue to dollar cost average in to Bitcoin and Ethereum. I have not made any altcoin purchases since my last update in [June](https://swoicik.com/2021/june-portfolio-updates). 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
