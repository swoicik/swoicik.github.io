Here is the July Portfolio Update. Not a lot to talk about this month, but there was a lot added last month if you want to take a look, [May Portfolio Updates](https://swoicik.com/2021/may-portfolio-updates). And for general background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

Two updates on the stock side of things.
- Sold BOX. This was a small postion I've had since 2015. It was part of an investment into the cloud storage and computing space. The basic thesis that Box would be the cloud storage choice for enterprise. Google and Microsoft have vastly improved their offerings toward business over the years, and I don't see a competitive advatange for BOX. I still like Box the company, but the stock has been flat and I don't see high growth in the future.
- Bought RBLX. This is where money from BOX was re-invested. I see a lot of growth potential with Roblox. They are in a growing market, have solid finacials, and have captured a set demographic. They have built a gaming and development platform that users are growing up learning on. 

Two Crypo Update
- Sold LTC. This was a poor investment from the start for me. I went in without an investing thesis or really understanding the technology behind it. I got swept up in the run up. Thanksfully this was a small postion and I got out almost as quick as I entered. I lost money on this investment. 
- Bought MATIC - I converted my LTC to MATIC. MATIC is a crypto I know much more about, and believe in what they are building. I could have waited longer, and hoped for the price to come down. I see MATIC as a good long term play (2-3 years) with a lot of room to grow. At the end of the day, I didn't belive buying at a slightly higher price was going to have a huge impact in the long run. 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.

As a final note, here is a stock from my watch list. COIN (Coinbase) has been one I am looking at a lot more. I do hold a very small position in them already. COIN has come way down from it's IPO price. The hype seems to have finally cooled off. The company, fundamentals, and outlook all remain the same, just the hype has gone away. I'm looking at the current stock price as a potential buying opportunity.
