Here are the January Portfolio Updates. For background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

I didn't published the December Portfolio Update (too busy with the holidays). I did take some money out of the market though. I typically do this in December with my brokerage account for a couple reasons. One, is to have extra money for the holidays. Two, is to take any losses to count against my yearly earnings. As I've mentioned in previous posts, I treat my brokerage account like a yearly savings account. Investments in brokerage are for short term. Investments in my retirement accounts are long term.

January has been a red month for the markets. I don't think a single stock is up in 2022. Which sounds like a great buying opportunity to me. I've added to a few of my positions in long term investments. Buying COIN, UPST, and RBLX. 

I have also been a lot more active in cryptocurrencies and now NFTs. I would not really cal NFTs investments yet, I'm still learning how it all works, but I am getting more involved with it. I don't believe the crypto percentages are completely accurate. With so much activity, assets are spread across different wallets. I need to updated my portfolio spreadsheet to get a completely accurate count of my crypto portfolio, but it's not drastically different (I suspect ETH has a higher percentage).

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
