What will the writing style be?

After writing down all the random notes, ideas, and research I had for <a href="/cyod">this book</a>, I needed to find a way to organize it all. I began looking at education and non-fiction books that I read and enjoyed. Looking at the structure and organization of the books, I tried to find a good fit for this book.

Two of my favorite non-fiction books are <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework">REWORK</a> and <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote">REMOTE</a>. Both books by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. The books are not just full of good content, but the content is presented in a very understandable and digestible way.

These books have great information broken up into short chapters/sections that fit into 3-4 main categories. This format makes the book’s information easy to digest and remember. It also makes it easy to refer back to content you like.

When I want to revisit an idea I like in one of the books, I will just reread the entire chapter (only a few paragraphs usually). I don’t have to hunt through pages of content to find the one paragraph that had the information I wanted in a long multipage chapter.

This structure is a great fit for the content of this book and how I write. Currently the book will be devices into 4 main categories; Introduction, Technology, Students, Teachers, Conclusion. Each category will have several sections, consisting of 1-3 paragraphs.

You can view the main categories and sections I have planned for each in the section folder on <a href="https://github.com/swoicik/cyod/tree/master/Sections">Github</a>.

If you have any suggestions for things to add to changes, please create an issue or comment on <a href="https://github.com/swoicik/cyod">Github</a> or message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik">Twitter</a>.

Thank you for following along on the progress of this book and project.
