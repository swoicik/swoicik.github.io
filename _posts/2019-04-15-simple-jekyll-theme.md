In my [previous post](https://swoicik.com/2019/wordpress-to-jekyll) about transitioning from WordPress or Jekyll, I mentioned I’d share the theme I used. After cleaning up the code and adding some generic theme options, I’m happy to share [Simple](https://github.com/swoicik/simple-jekll-theme).

Simple is a Jekyll theme I developed for use on swoicik.com. It’s based on the [Tale Theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) by Chester How.

Simple included lots of areas for personalization and an archive section organized by year. The Archive page will automatically populate as you publish blog posts. I’ve also added a directory for pages.

Feel free to use the theme for your own website and projects. You can fork or download the code directly on GitHub.

If you find any issues with the theme or have any questions, open an [issue](https://github.com/swoicik/simple-jekll-theme/issues) on GitHub or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swoicik). Any feedback is appreciated.
