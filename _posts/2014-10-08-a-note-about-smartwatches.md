First, I'm not against the idea of a smartwatch. I can certainly see myself wearing one in the future. The problem with current smartwatches is they are being marketed as add-on devices. A device that is a "compliment" to my phone.

A smartwatch need to be it's own device. A device that I can use without requiring me to carry multiple devices. I often carry around a tablet and a smartphone, but neither needs the other to function. A smartwatch needs to go beyond being a remote control for other device. It's great that it can sync and interact with other devices, but it can't require them to be functional.

Being required to carry around multiple devices to get functionality is a terrible design.

Give me a smartwatch that is functional on it's own, and I'll be sold.
