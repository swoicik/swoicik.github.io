I can't be the only person that does this. I have a backlog of interesting articles and links that I find while browsing the web. I might get to them someday, but why just horde them in my browser? 

Every so often, I will be sharing some links that I've found interesting enough to save. Some I've read, some I want to read, some I've saved away for a future idea. Hopefully you will get some benefit from the shared knowledge. 

[Firstdraft](https://rolandasb.github.io/firstdraft/#) - An interesting writing tool/project by Rolandas Barysas. This site helps you write your first draft and not be tempted to edit as you write by making your previous paragraph disappear from view as you go. 

[Gordon Hayward: the Pain, the Progress, the Prevail](https://evrd.net/blogs/news/gordon-hayward-the-pain-the-progress-the-prevail) - An excellent basketball article (especially for a Celtics fan like me) written by my brother, Evan Woicik. The article recaps the up and down and sometimes disappointing career of Hayward with the Celtics. 

[Psychodata](https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/2019/10/07/psychodata/) - 
An article about SEL, EdTech, and so much more by Ben Williamson. Anyone with an interest in educational technology or data privacy should take a look. Many interesting discussion starters are brought up. 

[22 Basic UX Laws That Every Designer Should Know](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/ux-laws) - A good informational article by Shopify Partners. I'd recommend any web developer or designer to give it a read. 

That's all I have for now. If you find any of these links useful or interesting, feel free to let me know on twitter, [@swoicik](https://twitter.com/swoicik).
