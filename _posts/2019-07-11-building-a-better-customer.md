For the past several months, [Rivik Media](https://rivikmedia.com) has been building a new website. It was a slow, very slow, process. Not because of the technical difficulty, but because of the research, psychology, and thought, that went into the site.

It was way more than a website refresh, it was a new identity for the company. A more mature identity. It got us thinking a lot about branding, clients, and where things will go in the future. It sent us down a wide variety of rabbit holes. 

Building a better customer was a driving idea behind it. How can we do more for our clients beyond getting them a website? How can we help them navigate being a small business online? 

It also led to starting a [newsletter](https://swoicik.com/newsletter) (and a few other projects to look out for). A way to share the information we've gained from years of owning a small business, and working with great small business owners. 

Here are a couple links that were helpful during this process. 

[Who Do You Love](https://justinjackson.ca/who-do-you-love) - This article was recently shared with us. It provides some great things to think about when you are starting a company. Beyond "will this make money." 

[1000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) - We have shared this article a few times in the past. It should be required reading for anyone looking to start a company, business, or side project to make money. 

A question to other business owners out there. What do you do to education your customers? Is that something you focus on? Do you think it's relevant to your business?
