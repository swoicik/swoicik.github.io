This website is now encrypted. Today, I added an SSL certificate to swoick.com. It is something I have wanted/needed for this site for sometime, and finally got done.

The whole process took about 10 minutes. I was able to get an SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let's Enctryp</a>t and set it up on my <a href="https://wpengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPEngine</a> install with no issues. I highly recommend anyone that runs a website to spend the 10 minutes and get set up with SSL.

What does this mean for readers? Nothing much will change with the actual site. You can continue to read and use the site as before. You can now feel safer browsing the site, and your browser will show the "Secure" icon in the URL.
