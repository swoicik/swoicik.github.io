It’s 2019 and I’m moving swoicik.com to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. 

For as long as this website has existed, it has been powered by WordPress. WordPress is an amazing platform, and has been a huge part of my career in web development. But... the platform has grown from its blogging roots into something much larger and complex. It was time to try something new. 

## Leaving WordPress  

**WordPress Baggage**
Over the past few years, WordPress has become a huge and powerful piece of software. It has become overkill for a personal blog. The maintenance required for the site is causing me to write less. I just don’t want to deal with WordPress side of WordPress. I just want to write. 

**Writing Environment**
The writing environment in WordPress has always been a bit cluttered. With the recent Gutenberg update it seems even more so. I don’t have the patience to deal with it, when all I want to publish is a simple text blog post. All the formatting and plugin options are overkill. 

**Mobile Publishing**
Publishing to a Jekyll site from my phone is simple. It’s the same workflow for any other GitHub project I may be working on. I write the post in iA Writer and Git Commit the post with Working Copy. Seconds later the post is live. 

Mobile publishing on WordPress has never been great. At best I can get a draft done in the mobile app before logging in on a desktop to actually publish the post. 

**Theme Editing**
WordPress themes have become more and more complex and harder to edit. Compared to editing a Jekyll theme it’s like night and day. 

## Why Jekyll 
I started my research by looking to other websites I liked. I found a lot of them were powered by Jekyll. Initially I though Jekyll would be too complex. After discovering how easy Jekyll is to run on GitHub Pages, I was sold. 

Jekyll is a platform focused on blog writing and not much else. It also had an active developer community that I could rely on. And the price of free is always helpful. 

**Markdown**
I take almost all of my notes in markdown. The drafts for all of the posts I write are done in markdown. Being able to keep everything in markdown from draft to publish is just easier.l and makes sense. 

**Text Backups**
All my posts live in a plain text directory, and they live on all my devices. There is something great about having everything is a truly portable format. Posts are backed up on GitHub and locally on the devices I have connected to the Git Repository. It’s a very simple and secure set up. 

**Price**
Jekyll is open source and free to use. GitHub Pages is free to use. This entire site is now free to develop and host (side note: I am a GitHub Pro subscriber). 

## How To Migrate to Jekyll 
Now that the reasons are out of the way, how did the actual migration go?
