<p id="1b7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There is this idea in marketing of “be everywhere.” The idea that your company needs to be everywhere so that you are in front of as many potential customers as possible.</p>
<p id="821f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I work with businesses just starting, one of the first things they want to do it set up Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, etc. They want their company and product to be in front of as many people as possible. It make sense to some extent. These services are a free way to market your company to millions of people that are already on them. But does it actually work? And what is the real cost?</p>
<p id="fa74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Social media takes time (and sometimes actual advertising dollars). Time that you are spending not working on your actual product. It’s a substantial commitment when you are just starting a company. Every profile you create is dividing your attention. You need to create posts ready, respond to interactions, and to be up to date.</p>
<p id="62a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So start slow and have a plan. Pick one or two profiles to start with. Set a schedule and make sure you have regular posts. It doesn’t have to be everyday, but every month is a good minimum. And if you aren’t finding a benefit from a social media account, delete it (or make it not public). It’s not great if a potential customer searches for you on social media and doesn’t find you, it’s a lot worse if they find you and your profile hasn’t been updated in 2 years.</p>
