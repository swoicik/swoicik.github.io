I wear headphones constantly, usually listening to an audiobook, podcast, or random playlist. While listening, I will usually remember something I needed to do, or get an idea to research further. Not wanting to or unable (driving) to interrupt what I am listing to, I need to make a quick note so I don't completely forget the idea.

Thanks to Siri, it's quick to just add these things to my reminders and continue with what I was doing.

The downside being, when I refer back to many of these reminders (sometimes days later), I lose context. I don't know what I was listening to when I made the reminder/note and don't know what I was thinking at the time.

What I need is a reminder/note app that works similar to Siri + Reminders that also takes into context what caused the need for the reminder/note.

For example a reminder or note that also includes the last 2 minutes of audio I was just listing to. Or a link to the last website I was at. Whatever I was doing right before I created the note is captured and saved as context for when I come back to it.

This technology might already exist. Or it may not be possible due to privacy settings on iOS. If anyone knows how this can be accomplished, please <a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik">let me know</a>.
