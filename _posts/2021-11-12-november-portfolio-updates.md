Here are the November Portfolio Updates. For background on why I publish these portfolio updates, go read [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money).

I missed October! But you didn't miss anything. I haven't made any moves with my investing portfolio. The market has been on the move, and I haven't seen a buying opportunity. There are a few moves I have thought about, but resisted. Sometimes the best action is to not do anything.

November, December, and maybe January will likely see some selling in my brokerage account. I will be taking some profits off the table and using the money for the holidays. Just for reference, I treat my brokerage account more like savings. I do not put stocks in there with a long term (multiple-years) time frame. Stocks are help under 1 year.

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
