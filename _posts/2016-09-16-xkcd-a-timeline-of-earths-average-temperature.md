If you don't already know about the webcomic <a href="http://xkcd.com/1732/">XKCD</a>, I definitely recommend checking it out. The author has created a very interesting/scary infographicÂ about how the average temperature of Earth has changed. Starting at 2000 BCE and including events that affected the environment.
