And we're off.... after a little over a year of development and testing, <a href="https://lewiscroft.com">Lewis Croft</a> is now available to the public. Membership is currently free but will be changed to a yearly paid subscription in the future. So if you're interested in joining, now is the best time.

Lewis Croft has been an idea for years and a project for the past 14 months. The goal it to build a community that I would want to be a part of. A community to help small business owners.

While running my own company for the past 9 years, I have been very fortunate to meet and learn from a number of other business owners. The advice and guidance from my peers has been what made my own success possible. I think every business owners should have access to this kind of community. That is why Lewis Croft was built.

I would like to thank everyone that helped in building this site. A lot of people offered their time, advice, and skill to build this site. You will find all of these people in the <a href="https://lewiscroft.com/members/">members area</a> of the site and on the <a href="https://lewiscroft.com/discussion/">discussion forums</a>. They are allÂ great resources for anyone running or starting a business. I encourage you to reach out to them in the forums. I will be introducing many of these people in the coming months, in the form of blog posts, articles, and interviews on <a href="https://lewiscroft.com/blog/">Lewis Croft</a>.

Thank you again to everyone that helped build this site, and to all the new members I hope you find the same benefit from this community as I have in running my small business.
