Every so often (when I have too many browser tab open), I will share links that I’ve found interesting enough to save. Some I’ve read, some I want to read, some I’ve saved away for a future idea. Hopefully you will get some benefit from the shared knowledge.

Volume 5 is just a random collection of links from random tweets and posts I've found that I didn't want to forget. 

**[Bookfeed](https://bookfeed.io/)** - A very simple idea and website built by [Lukas Mathis](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2021/02/16/bookfeed_io/). After you read a book you enjoy, you usually get a list of related books and content to read next. Bookfeed changes this to just show you more from that author. Enter the author you enjoyed reading and see all the latest releases from that author. You can even subscribe to the RSS feed of the author to be alerted when new books are published. I've created a couple already for some of my favorite authors. 

**[Cryptee](https://crypt.ee/)** - A privite and encrypted platform for storing documents, files, photos, and notes. Think of it as a much more private version of Dropbox or Google Drive. Cloud Storage is a fantasic tool, but letting companies have access to the files is usually the trade off. Cryptee aims to make sure you're files are your eyes only and not visible by anyone else. I haven't used this service personally yet, but it's on my list of things to try. 

**[Dshop](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/dshop)** - Dshop was created by [Origin](https://www.originprotocol.com/en) as a decentralized ecommerce platform. I first discovered it though the Brave Browser and their own [Swag Shop](https://store.brave.com/). It looks like an interesting way to build an online store and allows for accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. I haven't found an excuse to use this platform yet, but will keep it in mind for the future. It may be a good alternative to Shopify. 

**[Motion](https://www.inmotion.app/)** - This is a Chrome Browser Extension that aims to save time and make you more productive. The sales pitch and feature list is impressive. It combines a lot of features from other distraction free extensions I've used in the past. I've begun trying this on my own devices and have found it useful so far. If you use the Google Suite of apps for your work, you may find this tool useful. 

That’s all I have for now. If you find any of these links useful or interesting, feel free to let me know on twitter, [@swoicik](https://twitter.com/swoicik), or join the discussion [here](https://github.com/swoicik/swoicik.github.io/discussions/7).
