Every so often (when I have too many browser tab open), I will share links that I’ve found interesting enough to save. Some I’ve read, some I want to read, some I’ve saved away for a future idea. Hopefully you will get some benefit from the shared knowledge.

Welcome to Vol. 4 of Interesting Links (Investing Edition). If you haven't already read the post [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money), you should check it out. It will help put context around why investing and stocks are the theme this week.

**[Bookfeed](https://bookfeed.io/)** - 


That’s all I have for now. If you find any of these links useful or interesting, feel free to let me know on twitter, [@swoicik](https://twitter.com/swoicik).
