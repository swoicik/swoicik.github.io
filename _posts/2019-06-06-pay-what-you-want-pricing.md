> This post is part of an ongoing series of post related to the process of writing a book about educational technology. Learn more about the book [here](https://swoicik.com/cyod).

If you've been following along with the progress of the book, *CHOICE: Personalized Learning, Personalized Technology*, you'll know that it's now available for [pre-order](https://gumroad.com/l/CvEGu).

Before making the book available for pre-order, I had to decide how to price it. There is an infinite amount of resources available when it comes to pricing. Everyone has some kind of theory or advice and plenty of examples to back it up.

For me, it came down to accessibility and fairness. I already knew I would make the content of the book freely available (in some form). The goal of the book is to educate teachers and school administrators on how to make the best use of technology in education. And ultimately how to help students learn. Much of how I leaned was through free or donated resource. This is a way to give back.

This isn't information that should be behind a paywall. The impact is greater, the more accessible the information is.  

I am putting a lot of work into this project, and hope to do more like it in the future. I can't just work for free. So I landed on pay what you want pricing.

But there are a few catches....

You can order a digital copy of the book for $0. You can order a copy for $10 or $20 if you want. You can get a copy for $0, and later donate $10 if you think the book was worth it. Whatever fits your budget is the goal.

The physical copy of the book will not be free though. I have to pay to produce the book. There is a minimum payment of $12 to cover production and shipping costs.

Both of these options are only available through my [website](https://swoicik.com/cyod/) and [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/CvEGu).

The book will also be available on other platforms like Amazon Kindle and Barnes and Noble to $12.99. I can't offer pay what you want pricing on these platforms.

I hope that sheds some light and doesn't make things too confusing. If you have any questions, please reach out to me. My goal is to share this information with as many people as possible. I don't want money to be hindrance to accessing the information.
