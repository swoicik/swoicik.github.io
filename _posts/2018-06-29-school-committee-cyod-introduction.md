Receltny I spoke before the Maynard, MA School Committee to introduct the CYOD program. The program will be starting as a pilot for the incoming 5th grade class. The introduction starts at the 15 minute mark. The video gives a good overview of what the program is, its benefits, and how it will be implemetns in a real world K12 environment. At the end, I also answer questions from the community about the program.
