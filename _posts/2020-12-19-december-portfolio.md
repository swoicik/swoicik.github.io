Not too long ago, I published [Talking About Money](https://swoicik.com/2020/talk-about-money) on this site. That posts makes the argument that money should be a topic of conversation. It's the only way everyone will understand it better. 

In that post I shared my current investing portfolio and promised to post regular updates. Here is another update...

I recently did a deep dive on all of my current holdings. I looked at each stock, it's performance over the last several years, reviewed my thesis for buying the stock, and decided what I think the future of the stock would be. From doing that, I have several stocks now on a short list of possibly selling. The only one I have acted on so far is FFIV. 

I Sold F5 Network Inc. (FFIV). I no longer track this technology sector closely. I have held the stock since 2013. It has been a big gainer for me, but has slowed recently. The company also does not pay a dividend. The reasons I bought the stock no longer hold true. It is also in the middle of some activist investing. 

Selling the stock is not a signal that I think the stock will go down in the future. It's a signal that I can't predict the stock in the future. 

I have replaced the FFIV holding with MCD (McDonald's). This is a solid stock that pays a good dividend. I would rather have money sitting with a dividend paying stock that just sitting. 

Below is a list of my current portfolio and the percentage each investment takes up in the portfolio.
