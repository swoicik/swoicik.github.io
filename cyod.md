<p><strong>I am writing a book on Educational Technology based around the CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) 1:1 Model.</strong></p>
<p>This is my first attempt at writing a book. I am writing this book entirely in the public (a good idea or an insane one?). You can view the progress on <a href="https://github.com/swoicik/cyod">GitHub</a> or check the <a href="/category/cyod">CYOD Category</a> page for updates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments you can message me on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/swoicik">@swoicik</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-book" style="text-align: center;">The Book</h2>
<p>The focus of the book is, how to implement a successful and sustainable 1:1 program in a K12 environments. I advocate for the CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) model, but the ideas can be applied to any model you choose.</p>
<p>Too many well intentioned and well funded technology programs fall flat. Programs fail for any combination of reasons; planning, implementation, culture, understanding, communication, etc. I will share what I have learned and show how to mitigate or remove these obstacles. A 1:1 program is a lot more than just the device. The actual device(s) you choose matters very little.</p>
<p>The technology used in these programs changes constantly, so my focus will be on the systems you need in place to make the program work and less about specific technology. I want the content of the book to apply to any technology program you would run in education, not just a blip in time when (insert your favorite tech) is the current trend.</p>
<h3 id="why-a-book">Why A Book?</h3>
<p>Apart from being a goal to actually write a book, this format seemed the best way to distribute these ideas and best practices in the most beneficial and impactful way. It’s a scaleable way to share an idea.</p>
<h3 id="why-public">Why Public?</h3>
<p>Before deciding to attempt writing a book, I did a lot of research on how to write a book, and reached out to people that had done it before. I wanted an idea of what I was getting into. Most advice boils down to “Just write.” Good advice, but I needed more.</p>
<p>Writing a book is a weird thing. A person works almost in secret (or with a small group of people) for a very long time then releases everything into the world. The final product is known, but very little is shared about the process.</p>
<p>When I’m learning how to code something new, I don’t go look at the final products that people made, I look at the source code and try to figure out how they built it.</p>
<p>I wanted to share the entire process I’m going through (the source code of the book), hopefully it will help someone else.</p>
<p>There are lots of way to contribute and support this project. Any and all ways are greatly appreciated. Projects like this aren’t possible without a community of supporters around it.</p>
